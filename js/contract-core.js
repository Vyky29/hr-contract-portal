    'This letter is issued with your zero-hours employment contract to explain how workplace pension automatic enrolment applies to your employment with clubSENsational Ltd. We are required by UK law (the Pensions Act 2008) to operate qualifying workplace pension arrangements and to give you this information within six weeks of starting work with us.',
    'HOW AUTO-ENROLMENT WORKS',
    'Automatic enrolment means eligible workers are enrolled into a workplace pension scheme unless they choose to opt out within one month. Your eligibility is assessed using qualifying earnings paid by clubSENsational only. Earnings from any other employer are not counted, even if you have a higher salary elsewhere.',
    'For the current tax year, the main earnings threshold for automatic enrolment is ' + GBP + '10,000 per year from this Employer (' + GBP + '833 per month or ' + GBP + '192 per week). The lower qualifying earnings threshold is ' + GBP + '6,240 per year (' + GBP + '520 per month or ' + GBP + '120 per week).',
    'YOUR CURRENT POSITION',
    'You are employed on a zero-hours contract. You may not be automatically enrolled when you start if your earnings from clubSENsational are below the automatic enrolment threshold. This is common where staff also work for other employers.',
    'We will assess your earnings from clubSENsational on each payday. If you meet the eligibility criteria in a pay reference period, we will automatically enrol you and write to you, unless a lawful postponement applies.',
    'YOUR RIGHTS',
    '1. If you earn more than ' + GBP + '10,000 per year from clubSENsational and are aged at least 22 but under State Pension Age: we must automatically enrol you and pay employer pension contributions (minimum 3% of qualifying earnings, subject to scheme rules).',
    '2. If you earn between ' + GBP + '6,240 and ' + GBP + '10,000 per year from clubSENsational: you may opt in to our workplace pension scheme. If you opt in, we must pay employer contributions.',
    '3. If you earn below ' + GBP + '6,240 per year from clubSENsational: you may request to join our pension scheme, but we are not required to pay employer contributions.',
    '4. If you are automatically enrolled: you may opt out within one month of enrolment and receive a refund of contributions paid in that period, in accordance with scheme rules.',
    'CONTRIBUTIONS',
    'Where contributions apply, the minimum total contribution is ordinarily 8% of qualifying earnings between ' + GBP + '6,240 and ' + GBP + '50,270 per year, of which the employer pays at least 3% and the worker pays the remainder (with tax relief where applicable). Actual rates depend on the pension scheme rules.',
    'CONTACT AND FURTHER INFORMATION',
    'To opt in, ask questions, or notify us of a change in circumstances, contact HR at ' + HR_CONTACT_EMAIL + '.',
    'Independent guidance is available from The Pensions Regulator (www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk) and MoneyHelper (www.moneyhelper.org.uk).',
